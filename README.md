# PhotoShootWebApp
Very basic Web App enabling inserting and downloading images into the Database, along with rating and commenting them built with the help of Spring Boot, Angular and SQLite database.

Seeing how I had some problems with deployment, as for now in order to start working with it I suggest to using these commands in the root directory:

**mvn clean install -DskipTests**<br/>
**mvn spring-boot:run**

and then in the /ui directory:

**npm install**<br/>
**npm start**
